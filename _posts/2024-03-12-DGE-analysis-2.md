### Intro

We updated our DGE analysis with fresh and new GO terms! All of these lists with identified and unidentified DEG's are up on my account on [github](https://github.com/graceleuchtenberger/Byssus-expression-analysis/tree/4bb686e58b65494da14ea39f19c810caa0fcaefa/output/DEG_lists/with_GO_terms) for your own viewing. I will list out the number of DGE's between the treatment control and a treatment here, the number of ID'd transcripts, and the number of unidentified transcripts. At this point, the DGE's for the treatment control, if also present in the lab control, have had pre-lab expression accounted for in the log2fold change in expression.
