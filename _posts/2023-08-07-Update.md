# Injection in base of the foot

I injected one of the mussels in the base of the foot and I think I wounded its gill tissue, so it died. Injecting in the base is hard if it doesn't open up all the way, and I think it doesn't let them make threads. Maybe today I'll inject the adductor with rhodamine and see where it goes, but I think I might just stick to injecting the tip of the foot because I've had some success with that. The IDT shipment is coming in, so I think I'll try that this week and gather some foot samples. I think I should probably also take gill samples as a control.
