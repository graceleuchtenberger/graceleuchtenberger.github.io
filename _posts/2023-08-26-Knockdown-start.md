# Assay
1. Anesthetized 4 mussels in 1 L of 50 g/L MgCl water (600 mL fresh, 400 saltwater).
2. Numbered them with wire tags (8,9,10,12)
3. Treatments (~10 am that day)
    8: Given the scrambled negative control from IDT (100 uL, 1 mol). Injected in tip of foot.
    9: Injected with 100 uL of PBS in tip of foot.
    10: No injection
    12: Injected with the 626 (mgfp-3A) siRNA in the tip of the foot (100 uL, 2 mol, 45.205 ug total)
4. Allowed to sit and recover for 33 hours in tub of seawater in seatable with airstone.
5. Harvested at ~7 pm the next day. Mantle and foot tissue were taken (mantle served as control, uninjected tissue).
6. Tube ID's and treatments stored [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fqjU2ZVjJ5XLzkUsutMokC51U55JOw-TYs-WJzDeoS4/edit?usp=sharing).
7. Will do qPCR in Seattle to determine if knockdown actually worked. TBD.

Side note: mussels did not lay threads post recovery. It's been hard to get them to lay threads all summer, might be a food or stress issue. Also, I let it incubate for ~36 hours because I've read that siRNA's need around 24-48 hours to incubate before testing. People have also tested 7 days after.
