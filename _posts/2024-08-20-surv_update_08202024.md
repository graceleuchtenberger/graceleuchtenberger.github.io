## Live oysters

Had only 2 dead oysters in our cursed weekly bag this week.

You can see that decline in that one bag that I was discussing above (bag 22), that bag is now down to 72 oysters.

## Dead oysters

Cumulative dead in the weekly treatment continues to increase, but the standard error gets bigger, as the death is only increasing rapidly in one bag.

### Cumulative dead oysters effort D

Again, we can see our cursed bag rise above the ranks.

## Proportion survived

Counts were a little weird this week, some of our oysters were reported as missing, but I think they might've just gotten caught in the smaller mesh bag, so they weren't counted. We'll see next week.

### Proportion survived B
