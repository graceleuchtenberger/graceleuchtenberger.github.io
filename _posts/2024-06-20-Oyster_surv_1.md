### Procedure

1. Took [data sheets](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/data/survival/Westcott/Oystersurv_datasheet.docx) out to Westcott Bay at low tide with pencils, scissors, zipties.

2. Cut open oyster bags, pulled the oysters out by hand onto a tray and counted how many were alive, logged how many empty shells were found.

Some empty shells were leftovers from when the bags were used previously, found some that looked like ours though, and they were logged accordingly. Also found that tipping the racks to get the oysters caused some of them to fall out; we had some bags with way fewer oysters than expected (4 in effort D).

The rest of the bags were within 5 oysters of what was initially put in.

Effort B, Number of animals per bag: Mean 48, Std err 0.667
Effort D, Number of animals per bag: Mean 96.23, Std err 2.35
