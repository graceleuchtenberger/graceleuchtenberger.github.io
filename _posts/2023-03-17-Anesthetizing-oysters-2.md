# Results Day 2

1. Put 10 oysters from right bag with blue rubber band on it into bucket with 75 g/L solution, same amount of fresh and saltwater.

2. Should probably reduce salt water and up freshwater next time because the conductivity was really high (50 on the refractometer). Let sit for 8 hours.

4 were open, 6 were closed. For next time, will probably add more freshwater and let them sit for longer than 8 hours.
