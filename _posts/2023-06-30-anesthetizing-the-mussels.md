# What I'm doing and why

I'm putting the mussels in MgCl2 (hexahydrate) to anesthetize them and test my injection assay for the Mgfp-3 knockdown I want to do. I figure if I can knock the mussels OUT, and inject the foot, then I can knock Mgfp-3 DOWN (get it teehee).

I put 5 gallos in a bucket with 1 liter of water, 400 ml seawater and 600 ml of freshwater, plus 50 g of MgCl. This is following the same assay we did for the oysters for the Poly I:C pilot. I will check them at noon tomorrow (20-21 hrs).
