# The plan

I will be testing the effect of two thermal regimes on respiration rate.

Ramping treatment: I will have a mussel in aerated water in a chiller, ramping up the temperature from 12-24 degrees over 3 hours (12, 16, 20, 24).
Shock treatment: I will have a mussel in aerated water in a chiller at 12 degrees, bumping the temp up to 24 degrees after three hours.

Both mussels will hit 24 degrees at the same time, and be in the chillers for the same amount of time.

I then put each mussel in a nalgene bottle with holes in the top cap, through which I will measure O2 concentration before and after an hour at 24 degrees. The holes will be taped over for the hour that the trial is running.

Doesn't look like the ramp one respired that much at all, might be a fluke. Also may have put a gallo in the acute trial and a tross in the ramp trial by accident. I'll look closer tomorrow.
