#Results Day 1

1. Put the oysters in a 50 g/L MgCl solution for 8 hours. 600 ml of freshwater (DI), 400 ml of saltwater (from white jugs).

2. 5 were open (did not close when pressed 3 times), 5 were closed. Put back in water bath to recover in orange bag on left side of tank.

#Day 2 Plan

1. Put 10 oysters from right bag with blue rubber band on it into bucket with 75 g/L solution, same amount of fresh and saltwater. Should probably reduce salt water and up freshwater next time because the conductivity was really high (50 on the refractometer). Letting sit for 8 hours.
