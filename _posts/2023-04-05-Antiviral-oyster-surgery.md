# What's going on

1. Put 15 diploid and 15 triploid oysters in a 50 g/L MgCl bath to anesthetize them (about 18 hours). Then Matt injected 10 (5 diploid and triploid) with Poly-IC, emersed 10 in Poly-IC, and let 10 sit in the MgCl.

2. Took whole body oyster samples for oysters that were emersed in Poly-IC solution, oysters injected with Poly-IC, and oysters that just sat in the MgCl solution (triploids and diploids).

#Things I messed up (classic)

I mislabeled one of the triploid MgCl controls as an injected triploid. A loss. F.
