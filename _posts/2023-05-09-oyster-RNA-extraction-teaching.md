# What we did

## What we did on 5/2

1. Taught Henry and Eric about extraction, walked through updated version of Matt's protocol (RNAzol and column extraction) to extract RNA from whole oysters (D2, D3, D5, D6, D7 from injected group).

2. Got a ton more RNA from redoing the second part, but contamination was bad. See results below.

| ID | RNA conc (ng/uL) | 260/280 | 260/230 |
|---|---|---|---|
| D2 | 54.6 | 1.65 | 0.98 |
| D3 | 189 | 1.85 | 1.59 |
| D5 | 214 | 1.97 | 1.97 |
| D6 | 226 | 1.91 | 1.88 |
| D7 | 138 | 1.79 | 1.05 |

## What we did on 5/9

1. Got the QC values for the extraction above, also had Henry and Eric harvest the tissue from the oysters that got to recover for a month. 

# Points of reflection

1. The nanodrop curves for D2 and D7 were bad. Gonna need to reprocess the samples with Henry and Eric on Thursday the 11th. Not sure what happened there. Gonna start from the initial sample that we still have in RNAzol.

2. Next time, we're extracting more RNA, but I'm going to let Henry and Eric do the work while I will be there for questions or concerns. I think I'll have them do the lab controls for the monthly test, just as a lower stakes way to get more experience. I'll level them up to the injected ones again soon enough.
