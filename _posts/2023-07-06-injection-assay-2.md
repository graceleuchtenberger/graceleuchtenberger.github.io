# Where I left off
I injected three mussels out of 5 after anesthetizing them. Checked on them yesterday (7/4), and they were all alive. The only one that had laid a thread was mussel 5, an control that I didn't inject. 

Majority of mussels from initial anesthetization trial have laid threads now (about a week after). It's becoming clear that *I'll have to put the mussels in flowing water to encourage byssal thread production post-injection.*


# What I'm doing today

Monitored mussels for health. They are all well, breathing and closing when I touch them. Again, only 5 had laid a thread, the rest of them have not.

#What I should do

Get a smaller gauge needle first, from stockroom or otherwise.

Put the mussels in flow after injection.
