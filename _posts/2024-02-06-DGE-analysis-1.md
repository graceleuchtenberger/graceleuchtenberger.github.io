I ran PCA's and got significant DEG lists for every pairwise comparison between the true control (control, day 0) and day 3 of every treatment (ocean acidification (OA), ocean warming (OW), hypoxia (DO), and control). PCA's are below. Ellipses are 95% confidence areas (?). DEG's are in my environment on Raven, not sure what to do with them as of yet.
