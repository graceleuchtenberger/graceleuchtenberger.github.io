### Intro

I didn't make all the PCA's for all treatments in my previous post: here they are. Going to proceed with the genome as well given that, when blasting a fasta file of all published Gill proteins (searched "mytilus foot proteins" on NCBI, took most of the nucleotide results from that search), we got 239 hits on our isoseq and 278 on the genome. E value of 1E-20. Code is [here](https://github.com/graceleuchtenberger/Byssus-expression-analysis/blob/main/code/MFP-blast.Rmd).
