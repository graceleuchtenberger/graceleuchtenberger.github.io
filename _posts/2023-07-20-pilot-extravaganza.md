# Executed plan for today

## Thread quality

I put three mussels in the big tank outside of the gear locker (lab 7), half way around the tank from three water pumps stacked vertically. Here's a bird's eye view:

The black circle is the tank drain, the box next to it is the top pump, and the mussels are experiencing different levels of flow, denoted by different length arrows.

## Injection again

I anesthetized 5 mussels with 50 g/L, and they were in for almost 24 hours. Only one mussel didn't open. I injected the distal part of the feet with a 30 gauge needle.

I didn't see leakage of proteins this time, so that's good. Seems like that needle worked better. I put them all in the small flume after at some setting between 60 and 80.

13 and 14 were the only ones that weren't injected. I forget the numbers of which ones I injected, but they are closest to the oncoming flow in the flume.
