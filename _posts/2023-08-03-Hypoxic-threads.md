# New thread pilot

I tried a new thing at Emily's suggestion of letting mussels lay threads in hypoxic and oxygen-rich environments. I got two jars, put a mussel in each, and bubbled one (O2 rich) while filling the other one up to the top and covering it (hypoxic). I let them sit overnight (5pm to 9am).

The hypoxic mussel did not lay any threads while the oxygen rich one laid five. The O2 level also got down to 20 umol/L in the hypoxic one, and stayed above 200 for the O2 rich treatment.

Seems like this has been done before, and done better by others. Maybe I can integrate HIFa and MFP expression into this to just to see what's going on, but I'm not sure.
