## Procedure

Same as last week. Adjustments seem to be working well.

## Live oysters

### Mean live oysters per treatment

We're seeing the mean live oysters in weekly bags decline again because we once again had 6 dead oysters in the same bag that we had 6 dead last week.

### Live oysters in B

### Live oysters in D

You can see that decline in that one bag that I was discussing above (bag 22), that bag is now down to 88 oysters.

## Dead oysters

### Cumulative mean dead oysters per bag

Cumulative dead in the weekly treatment continues to increase, but the standard error gets bigger, as the death is only increasing rapidly in one bag.

### Cumulative dead oysters effort B

We did not lose any oysters in the effort B bags this week (either to death or negligence).

### Cumulative dead oysters effort D

That dot that was at 7 last week is now at 13. This is the same bag.

## Proportion survived

### Mean proportion survived

Everything is holding steady or going up (better counting procedures), while weekly is declining.

### Proportion survived B
