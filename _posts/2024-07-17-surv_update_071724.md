### Procedure

Newest survival data and death data plotted out.


### Mean live oysters per treatment

Mean live oysters looks fairly static overall, but a slight decline in mean live oysters for the weekly treatment. We found 6 dead in a weekly bag today, so that is probably driving it.

### Cumulative mean found dead oysters per bag

Weekly treatment seems to be leading the way for cumulative dead oysters per bag. Again, likely due to us finding 6 dead in one bag today.

### Cumulative dead oysters effort B

### Cumulative dead oysters effort D

You can see which bag has lost the most oysters (lost all of them in one go, bag 22 for weekly treatment).
