### Procedure  

Adjustments still really working! We now have two whole months of survival data.

## Live oysters

### Mean live oysters per treatment

Had 7 dead oysters in our cursed bag this week, that's why the "weekly" mean continues to decline

### Live oysters in B

### Live oysters in D

You can see that decline in that one bag that I was discussing above (bag 22), that bag is now down to 78 oysters.

## Dead oysters

### Cumulative mean dead oysters per bag

Cumulative dead in the weekly treatment continues to increase, but the standard error gets bigger, as the death is only increasing rapidly in one bag.

### Cumulative dead oysters effort B

### Cumulative dead oysters effort D

Again, we can see our cursed bag rise above the ranks.

## Proportion survived

### Mean proportion survived

Everything is holding steady or going up (better counting procedures), while weekly is declining.

### Proportion survived B
